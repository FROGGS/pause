=head1 PAUSE repository

This repository is considered to contain all relevant programs and
configuration data for running pause.perl.org except for the SSL key
and certificate and files containing passwords or other sensible data.

=head2 Excluded files

The following files have been excluded from the repository for obvious
reasons:

    apache-conf/156e8318.0
    apache-conf/18065281.0
    apache-conf/67ff2224.0
    apache-conf/pause.pem
    apache-conf/pause.pem3
    apache-conf/pause.pkey
    apache-svn-conf/passwd.pause
    etc/mon.cf
    privatelib/PrivatePAUSE.pm

PrivatePAUSE.pm contains only the usernames and passwords of the mysql
users that own the two databases. See lib/PAUSE.pm for the structure
of the data.

=head2 File system layout

On PAUSE the files live in /home/k/PAUSE and the following symlinks
make sure that installed programs find their configuration:

=head2 External programs to run PAUSE

  apache with mod_perl and Apache-SSL
  perl
  mirror (the good old)
  mon
  proftpd
  mysql
  rsync (runs as daemon)

=head2 Database schema

The files doc/*.schema.txt document the schema of the two databases. A
dump of the mod database is produced every few hours and available for
download in the ftp area. A dump of the authen_pause database is -- of
course -- not available.

=head2 User management

PAUSE is running processes as user root, nobody, SVN, and UNSAFE.
