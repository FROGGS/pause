Bouncing mails: we should do something to inform users who's mails
bounced. Ideally we would say: "Recent mails from PAUSE to you could
not be delivered. We tried sending you mail to foo@bar.com. As
foo@bar.com is still your email adress according to PAUSE's database,
there may be the need that you update your account info." Thank you.
Step 1: write current_email_address() and put the email info in a
permanent place on all pages.

On a related front we must revisit all places where we determine the
email addresses where we send a message to and where we allow one mail
with multiple addresses and where we force multiple mails. I think in
the context of reindex I now fixed the bug that we did allow one mail
with multiple addresses, but we did send to both secret and public
address. That's what we must fix everywhere.
