Work on misleading menu items logout/switch user. (Gabor Szabo)

Switch the rest to 5.8.0.

Complete etc/rc.d/init.d directory: mysql is missing, mon, others?

Document needed aliases and modules@ mailing list.

mldistwatch: determine symlinks in modules/ symlinktrees more
efficiently

Bouncing mails: we should do something to inform users who's mails
bounced. Ideally we would say: "Recent mails from PAUSE to you could
not be delivered. We tried sending you mail to foo@bar.com. As
foo@bar.com is still your email adress according to PAUSE's database,
there may be the need that you update your account info." Thank you.
Step 1: write current_email_address() and put the email info in a
permanent place on all pages.
