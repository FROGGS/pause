PAUSE currently uses the <i>Basic Authentication Scheme</i> according
to the HTTP specification. This means that your browser sends your
username and password with every request to the server. In that sense
you are never logged into the server as in telnet or ftp connections.
Every request is made independently from all previous requests and in
that sense there is no concept of logging out. However, the user
usually <i>perceives</i> the dialog as a session that is equivalent to
a telnet or ftp session. But PAUSE does nothing to support this
concept.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, as long as your browser remembers your userid and
password, it will send the associated HTTP header to PAUSE and PAUSE
will answer the request. Browsers handle the cache of authentification
data differently. If you want your browser to forget them, most
browsers require you to shut the browser down.
</p>

<p>
However, Netscape 4 had the convenient behaviour that if the server
sent a status code of 401 (HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED), it presented the user
with a new login dialog. This dialog could be used to login with a
different name and different password. If the different name and
password were bogus, this method allowed you to effectively "log out",
in the sense that a new authentication was required to talk to PAUSE.
If you want to get such a <i>401</i> status code once, please <a
class="menuitem" href="authenquery?please_renegotiate_username">click
here</a>. Internet Explorer and Mozilla do not behave like this, at
least not on the versions I have tried. You will just get a <i>401</i>
page ("Authorization required" or some such) and no new
authentification dialog box. As a consequence you can still visit
PAUSE after that without having to type in username and password, so
these browsers can not be tricked into forgetting the credentials. You
have been warned.
</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you're just interested to see how PAUSE
looks like for not authenticated users, please <a class="menuitem"
href="query">click here</a>. This brings you to a different
<i>realm</i> on PAUSE that doesn't need authentication. If you go
there, your browser will not forget your username and password.
