  <dt><b>1999-12-09</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>My current Todo list is mostly unchanged since October:
UTF8-ification, trigram search for authors and modules which directs
to a page with item-related menues, per-author inventory page, fix
false positives in mldistwatch and mail the reports to the authors,
open perms table, arbitrary voting ala Slashdot, make more error
conditions visible via web interface. Longer term: Date/Time chapter
and flexibility to add more chapters (e.g. symlink tree washer).</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-12-09</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>In addition to the old 4GB disk PAUSE gets my spare 9GB disk.
Indended use: public archive of all authors directories starting with
day zero (i.e. as if no deletions had ever happened).</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-10-26</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Entry page now has short blurb about all available menu items,
both for users and admins.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-10-25</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Mailinglist representatives now supported (beta).</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-10-22</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Repair tool for unsuccessful uploads now available (beta).</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-10-22</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Bugzilla declared inappropriate for PAUSE. Closed the Bugzilla
tables by dropping database "bugs" after making a backup.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-10-21</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Module list catchup <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-10/msg00903.html">posting</a>.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-10-20</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Edit module form now available for authors.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-10-19</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Installation of a form that lets at least people with admin
privileges edit the <i>mods</i> table of the database directly. At the
same time the scripts to produce a new module list have been made
lighter and use the modulelist template only for formatting and
sequence hints. This revolutionary step was inspired by Kurt
Starsinnic during the Perl Conference 3. I've uploaded the very last
module list that was produced by the old scripts, version 2.58.
There's still a lot of work to do to make the form usable for the
authors, but we have a step forward.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-08-31</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Installation of a passwordmailer. Users can now lose their
password and aren't locked out.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-08-07</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>PAUSE database switches to mysql.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-08-05</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>PAUSE has a <a href="/pause/">new interface</a>. 80% of the old
stuff seem to be ported and the core of the old scripts has
redirectors to the new style.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-07-04</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Loic Dachary installs <a href="/bugzilla/">Bugzilla</a>.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-07-03</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Andreas K&ouml;nig and Loic Dachary roll up their virtual
sleeves to start improving PAUSE. They rewrite the schema of the
database to fit as good as possible for both mSQL and mysql for an
easier transition path.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-05-17</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Upgrade to perl5.00556, apache 1.3.6, modperl 1.19-dev,
openssl-0.9.2b, Ben-SSL 1.34.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-04-23</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Upgrade to Linux 2.2.6. Security checked with
nessus-alpha2-fix3.</li></ul></dd>


  <dt><b>1999-02-15</b></dt>
  <dd>Up to apache-1.3.4, mod_perl-1.18, Ben-SSL-1.31. Perl untouched.</dd>

  <dt><b>1998-12-22</b></dt>
  <dd>Better luck with Ben-SSL 1.29. SSL server up again. I don't know
what was it that was misconfigured.</dd>

  <dt><b>1998-12-20</b></dt>
  <dd>PAUSE moves to speed-link.de, my future
employer who is sponsering a 2 MBit line. The new machine is an AMD
K6-2/300 with 128M memory and a 4GB disk. As it has an UW SCSI
controler, it will be easy enough to add a bigger disk in a year or
so. While moving I upgraded to perl5.005_54 with apache 1.3.3, mod_ssl
2.1.2, and mod_perl 1.16_03-dev. SSL didn't work with the setup. </dd>

  <dt><b>1998-09-21</b></dt>
  <dd>Apache upgrade: now perl5.005_51 with
apache-1.3.1 with Ben-SSL 1.24 with mod_perl 1.15_01. Finally we're
running with the gcache enabled and hopefully will enjoy the speedup.<br />

For the future I'm planning to make pause.perl.org a CA. I'm not yet
sure what's the best upgrade path to achieve that. It seems to need
yet another name for PAUSE, but it's possible that this name will last
for a longer time than those of its predecessors. Suggestions from SSL
pros welcome. Thanks!</dd>

  <dt><b>1998-06-03</b></dt>
  <dd>PAUSE has a new home. The old server was a
68040 NeXT 25 MHz which started to behave peculiarly. It was both slow
and a risk. The new machine is a 100MHz 486 Linux machine. Not a
thrill, but it should do for the job for a while. What matters more
than performance is that I do not have to port so much software to the
box, because I have all the things I need easily available.<br />

A necessary side effect of the relocation is a new SSL certificate.
This time I was clever enough to let it expire in &gt;10 years from
now. I hope this works out well.<br /> 

I apologize to all those who had to wait for quite a while to be
registered, I hope all future requests can be served within 3 days. If
we cannot manage that, we definitely need a new approach, but I'm
quite positive that we can make registering easier and faster.</dd>

  <dt><b>28 Dec 1997</b></dt>
  <dd>
Upgrade to mod_perl 1.07_02.</dd>

  <dt><b>24 Oct 1997</b></dt>
  <dd>
Upgrade to perl5.004_04, apache 1.2.4 with Ben-SSL, mod_perl 1.05_01.</dd>

  <dt><b>1 Sep 1997</b></dt>
  <dd>
Upgrade to perl5.004_03, apache 1.2.4.</dd>

  <dt><b>2 Aug 1997</b></dt>
  <dd>
Upgrade to perl5.004m2t2, apache 1.2.1, and mod_perl 1.00. Upgraded to
MakeMaker-5.42 which has the new parse_version method that sets
$VERSION to "undef" if the $VERSION is undefined.</dd>

  <dt><b>6 Jul 1997</b></dt>
  <dd>
Upgrade to perl5.004_01, apache 1.2.0, and mod_perl 1.00b1</dd>

  <dt><b>26 May 1997</b></dt>
  <dd>
Authentification handler now case-insensitive, so users may log in as
lwall instead of only LWALL. This was the most prominent mistake
people made and cause for lots of grief. With mod_perl, this business
is a breeze.</dd>

  <dt><b>27 Apr 1997</b></dt>
  <dd>
Server up to apache-1.2b9-dev, perl5.003_97i, mod_perl-0.9701, the
first with CGI.pm and no CGI::XA.</dd>

  <dt><b>16 Mar 1997</b></dt>
  <dd>
Server up to apache-1.2b8-dev, perl5.003_93, mod_perl-0.94.</dd>

  <dt><b>24 Feb 1997</b></dt>
  <dd>
Server up to apache-1.2b7, perl5.003_28.</dd>

  <dt><b>11 Feb 1997</b></dt>
  <dd>
Server up to apache-1.2b6, mod_perl-0.93, perl5.003_26, LWP 5.07,
HTTPD-Tools-0.53.</dd>

  <dt><b>25 Jan 1997</b></dt>
  <dd>
Server is now close to apache-1.2b5, mod_perl-0.92, perl5.003_23. LWP
5.05 is patched to use overload instead of %OVERLOAD.</dd>

  <dt><b>21 Dec 1996</b></dt>
  <dd>
HTTP Server is upgraded to apache-1.2b2, mod_perl-0.86, perl5.003_13.
majordomo is now 1.94.</dd>

  <dt><b>27 Sep 1996</b></dt>
  <dd>
Installed ssh-1.2.14 and disabled all r* commands.</dd>

  <dt><b>21 Aug 1996</b></dt>
  <dd>
All scripts are now available both as traditional CGI scripts and as
mod_perl scripts. On PAUSE the /perl/ directory is just a symlink to
the /cgi-bin/pml/ directory. So the traditional and the mod_perl
scripts are identical. Most scripts here on PAUSE require a password,
but if you have no password, I have prepared a simple read-only
example for you. Here is one and the same script

<ul>
  <li>running slow as <a
href="/cgi-bin/pml/who_is">traditional CGI</a>,</li>
  <li>running fast as <a
href="/perl/who_is">Apache::Registry subroutine</a>.</li>
  <li>Read the <a href="/modulelist/who_is">source code</a>.</li>
</ul>

You should be aware that this is running on a 25 MHz Motorola NeXT
over a 64k link, so you may not see a big difference.</dd>

<dt><b>20 Aug 1996</b></dt>

Pause gets as a birthday present a new apache-1.1.1 server with
perl-5.003_02 embedded. If you have missed the statistics posting,
Here it is again (slightly enhanced):

<pre>
		     20 Aug 1995                20 Aug 1996

</pre>

<b>Files</b> are the most recent versions of distribution files. Foo-1.00
and Foo-1.01 count as one.<br />

<b>Files-passed</b> are the distributions that have been passed
through PAUSE. Not the readmes and checksums and indices nor those
that went through more than once.<br />

<b>MB-passed</b> is the size of the files in the previous line in
Megabytes.<br />


<b>Namespace</b> are package declarations found within the *.pm files.</dd>
